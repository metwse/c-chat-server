# Chat Server
Simple TCP-based chat server.

## Running 
Execute `run.sh` in the repository folder to run the program. Tests can be run
by command `./runtest.sh <test_name>` in the test's working directory.

## Documentations
To generate documentation, you need to install `graphviz` and `doxygen`. Auto-
generating documentation is quite straightforwardâ€”simply running doxygen in the
repository should generate HTML documentation at 
`generated-docs/html/index.html`.
